                        A child was born, and the world didn’t know that this child will change the world. Steve Jobs’ biological mother was a young, unwed college graduate, and she decided to put him up for adoption. His biological mother later found out that the adoptive mother
                        had never graduated from college and that the father was not even graduated from high school. She refused to sign the final adoption papers. She only relented a few months later when his adoptive parents promised that he would
                        go to college someday.

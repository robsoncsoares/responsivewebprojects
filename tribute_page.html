                <h2>1955 - The adopted son of Paul Jobs</h2>
                <p> A child was born, and the world didn’t know that this child will change the world. Steve Jobs’ biological mother was a young,      unwed college graduate, and she decided to put him up for adoption.
                    His biological mother later found out that the adoptive mother had never graduated from college and that the father was not even graduated from high school. She refused to sign the final adoption papers. She only relented a few months later when his adoptive parents promised that he would go to college someday.

                <h2>1969 - College drop-out</h2>
                <p>
                    The young Jobs graduated from his high school and joined the course at Reed College in Portland, Oregon. During the time, Jobs had no idea on what he wanted to do with his life, and he was spending all of the money his parents had saved their entire life, so he decided to drop the course after only 1 semester, mainly because he could not afford the course.
                    The financial difficulties didn’t stop the young man’s passion, he rolled auditing classes at Reed College. Since then, he collected and returned Coke bottles just to get himself some food money, and got his weekly free meals at the local Hare Krishna temple.

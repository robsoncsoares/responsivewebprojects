                    <h2>Introduction</h2>
                    <p>
                        Steven Paul Jobs, better known as Steve Jobs CEO of Apple, was born in 1955 and officially left
                        us on October 5th, 2011. He was one of the key person bringing the true innovation to the world.
                        He showed us how making the difference can change the world. He changed the way we interact with
                        gadgets and computers. And when he left, he left behind a great deal of legacy he created and
                        improved. He just changed the world. In this timeline we will learn about Jobs' entire
                        trajectory.

                        A child was born, and the world didn’t know that this child will change the world. Steve Jobs’
                        biological mother was a young, unwed college graduate, and she decided to put him up for
                        adoption. His biological mother later found out that the adoptive mother had never graduated
                        from college and that the father was not even graduated from high school. She refused to sign
                        the final adoption papers. She only relented a few months later when his adoptive parents
                        promised that he would go to college someday.

                    <p>
                        The young Jobs graduated from his high school and joined the course at Reed College in Portland,
                        Oregon. During the time, Jobs had no idea on what he wanted to do with his life, and he was
                        spending all of the money his parents had saved their entire life, so he decided to drop the
                        course after only 1 semester, mainly because he could not afford the course. The financial
                        difficulties didn’t stop the young man’s passion, he rolled auditing classes at Reed College.
                        Since then, he collected and returned Coke bottles just to get himself some food money, and got
                        his weekly free meals at the local Hare Krishna temple.

                        CEO. Later, Jobs persuaded John Sculley, who was the CEO of Pepsi-Cola, to serve as Apple’s CEO,
                        with a very famous question: “Do you want to sell sugar water for the rest of your life, or do
                        you want to come with me and change the world?” During his days, he helped the Apple to increase
                        its sales from $800 million to $8 billion. In 1987, Sculley was Silicon Valley’s highest paid
                        executive, withdrawing USD $2.2 million annually.

                        of the Macintosh division, and later Jobs was fired by his own founded company, Apple.
                        Nevertheless he described that the firing was the best thing happened to his life, noting that
                        “The heaviness of being successful was replaced by the lightness of being a beginner again, less
                        sure about everything. It freed me to enter one of the most creative periods of my life.”

                        Computer, which produced highly advanced computer, but was ignored by market with
                        “cost-prohibitive” as the primary reason. Like any other Apple product, Jobs ran the NeXT with
                        the obsession for aesthetic perfection, but only 50,000 units of the machines were sold. Due to
                        the production constraint, NeXT transitioned fully to software development with the release of
                        NeXTSTEP/Intel.

                        Pixar today. The company was initially producing the high-end graphic hardware, but as the
                        business didn’t go well, the company then contracted with Disney to produce a number of
                        computer-animated films, and the Toy Story 1 was one of its notable successes. Pixar was later
                        purchased and taken over by Disney in early 2006. Jobs served as director of Disney, and he was
                        the largest single stockholder with 7% of the company’s stock.

                    <p>
                        Apple, being experienced a series of business and innovation failure, bought the NeXT to bring
                        back the Jobs to the company. Jobs was then named as the interim chief executive. After the
                        return of the Jobs, he terminated a number of projects which he thought was useless to the
                        company’s business. It’s quite interesting to note that Apple’s employees were having fear to
                        encounter the Jobs while riding the elevator that time, fearing that they might be the next
                        batch to be fired by Jobs.

                    <h2>2004 - Jobs diagnosed with pancreas cancer</h2>
                    <p>
                        They said every genius does not have longer life, and it appears to be true. Jobs was diagnosed
                        with a cancerous tumor in his pancreas, which doctor advised him to get his affairs in order,
                        and told him that he should expect to live no longer than 3-6 months. For him, it means to say
                        goodbye. Jobs announced to his employees about the diagnosis result. However, he also stated
                        that it is rare, far less aggressive type tumor. He resisted the conventional medical
                        intervention (chemotherapy/radiation therapy) and embraced the diet method to cure the disease.
                        It was a successful tactic, the tumor was reported to be "apparently removed". After the
                        surgery, Jobs announced in his email to Apple’s employees that he would take the entire August
                        off to take care of his health, and expects to recover from the pancreatic cancer. He planned to
                        return to work in September. Tim Cook (current Apple CEO), head of worldwide sales and operation
                        at that time, took over Apple for the first time.

                        Steve Jobs delivered his commencement speech to the Stanford’s graduate. The speech was split
                        into 3 main topics, with the first topic focused on his earlier life, second topic focused on
                        his leaving from Apple and founding of NeXT, and the currently infamous third part – the death.
                        The speech ended with the advice from Jobs – “Your time is limited, so don’t waste it living
                        someone else’s life. Don’t be trapped by dogma – which is living with the results of other
                        people’s thinking. Don’t let the noise of others’ opinions drown out your own inner voice. And
                        most important, have the courage to follow your heart and intuition.“

                        announced a six-month leave until the end of June 2009 to allow him to focus on his health. Tim

                    Tie-dye as we know it became popular in the United States in the mid-1950 's. People used direct dying methods with either "natural" or grocery-store type dyes-- randomly folding, twisting, and tying fabric or clothing . The items were then either dipped
                    or put into a dye bath. The results were simple and varied designs; but they were not vibrant and tended to fade quickly. Still, everybody loved them! TIEDYENAT is specialist in the artisanal production of tie-dye in the most varied
                    types and styles promoting diversity. We produce to order.
